### What is Linux?

[Linux (/ˈlɪnʊks/, LIN-uuks)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) is a family of open-source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel, an operating system kernel first released on September 17, 1991, by Linus Torvalds. Linux is typically packaged as a Linux distribution (distro), which includes the kernel and supporting system software and libraries—most of which are provided by third parties—to create a complete operating system, designed as a clone of Unix and released under the copyleft GPL license.

### Windows advantages and Disadvantages

As someone who has been using Windows since 2015, I feel that Windows is the most comfortable and easy to use operating system because almost everything in Windows is based on the (GUI) Graphical User Interface. For example, when installing applications/programs, we can use the Microsoft Store (on Windows 10 and above) or use the installer provided by the application developer, and you really only need to open and click next, next, next... and install, done. To open an application or program, it's easy, you just need to click on the shortcut provided on the desktop or in the start menu.

On average, desktop and game application developers prefer Windows as their target market. Because, globally, many computer users use Windows more than other operating systems.

Based on the data above, Windows occupies the top position as the most users with a percentage of 72.44%, followed by OS X/Mac OS (15.94%), unregistered OS (5.32), Linux (4%), Chrome OS (2.3%) and FreeBSD (0.01 %). So, Windows won by a landslide in dominating the desktop OS market. Because of that, if our Windows experiences a crash or error, we will easily find information and tutorials. Currently, there are lots of Windows tutorials that we can search for on the internet, especially YouTube.

On the other hand, there are also disadvantages of windows, among others:

**1. Security Vulnerabilities**

    One of the most significant weaknesses of the Windows Operating System is its vulnerability to security threats. As one of the most widely used operating systems, there are also many threats to come. Such as the many types of viruses or malware created for Windows, the potential for system exploitation by hackers, and phishing and social engineering attacks as a result of a lack of user awareness.

**2. High Resource Requirements**

    The Windows operating system requires qualified components to run optimally, such as requiring more RAM and a fast CPU. Installing and updating Windows also requires a large disk. Some old components no longer work properly on Windows, causing lag and performance reduction.

**3. Cost**

    Windows is not free.

**4. Frequent Updates**

    Regular updates are essential for security and performance, but [Windows is known for its frequent updates](https://www.computerworld.com/article/1611254/managing-rapid-fire-windows-updates.html). These updates can be disruptive, requiring significant installation time and system restarts.

### Linux has better performance?

As I explained above, Windows performance is less stable when used on old computers. Then what about Linux? 

The device I use is [Lenovo Ideapad 1 14igl7](https://els.id/product/lenovo-ideapad-slim-1-14igl7-intel-celeron-8gb-ssd-512gb/) with Intel Celeron N4020 iGPU, 8 GB RAM and 256 GB SSD. Actually, I regret buying this laptop, because there are other laptops with the same price but the specifications are much better.

The distro I use is Ubuntu.

It can be seen that the average CPU used when idle is only 8%, that is a very small number.

I tried Minecraft java vanilla, windowed mode, without mods with default settings and the results really surprised me. My device is able to get a stable fps around 50 - 60 fps.

Maybe you don't think this is very interesting, but you need to remember that the device I use uses an Intel Celeron, which is an entry level processor with low performance, but saves power. 

Currently I am installing Ubuntu dual boot with Windows. And after I installed Ubuntu for the first time, I rarely used Windows for daily use. I spend more time on Ubuntu because it is comfortable and smoother. But unfortunately I only allocated a 20 GB disk for Ubuntu. Maybe later I will use Ubuntu completely.

### Conclusion

So the conclusion is that whatever operating system you use, it depends on your needs. My job is coding and mostly using the terminal so Linux suits me. For gamers and office workers, it would be better to use Windows because many programs are compatible with Windows rather than Linux.
