As a game developer with a passion for simplicity and charm, I’m thrilled to share my latest project—a casual pixel art game that brings the art of being a barista to life. Inspired by the delightful mechanics of *Root Beer Tapper* from the Panic Playdate console, this game is designed to be fun, accessible, and a visual treat for players of all ages.

### **The Concept**

The game revolves around a simple yet satisfying gameplay mechanic: pouring coffee into cups. Players take on the role of a skilled barista, working to serve customers by filling their cups with perfectly poured coffee. While the concept is straightforward, mastering the timing and precision required to fill cups just right adds a layer of challenge and excitement.

### **The Art Style**

One of the standout features of this game is its pixel art design. Every visual element, from the characters to the environment, is crafted with love and attention to detail using **Blockbench**. This 3D modeling tool has allowed me to experiment with isometric-style sprites and animations, bringing a unique depth and charm to the game’s aesthetic.

### **The Engine**

I chose **Godot Engine** for its versatility and user-friendly interface, making it the perfect choice for developing this type of project. The engine’s robust 2D tools and open-source nature align with my goals for creating a game that is lightweight, responsive, and visually appealing.

### **Gameplay Inspiration**

This game draws heavy inspiration from *Root Beer Tapper*, a classic that combines quick reflexes with engaging gameplay. My goal is to capture the same sense of rhythm and satisfaction while adding my unique twist with coffee-themed visuals, quirky customer animations, and modern pixel art.

### **What’s Next?**

Currently, I’m focused on refining the gameplay mechanics and polishing the art assets to create a cohesive and immersive experience. I aim to include features like:
- Multiple difficulty levels.
- A variety of coffee types and customers.
- Fun, interactive sound effects to enhance the gameplay.

The project is still in its early stages, but I’m excited about the progress so far and can’t wait to share updates as development continues.

### **Join the Journey**

If you love casual games with a nostalgic twist or enjoy the art of pixel design, I’d love to hear your thoughts on this project. Stay tuned for more updates as I pour my heart (and coffee) into bringing this game to life. Let’s make something fun and unforgettable together! ☕
