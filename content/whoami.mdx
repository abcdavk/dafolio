Hi, I’m Dave, and welcome to my blog!

I come from Indonesia and grew up in a humble family, which has shaped me into the independent and resilient person I am today. I work as a freelancer on Fiverr, specializing in game modding, creating Telegram bots, and building simple websites using React.js. My work allows me to explore creativity while providing solutions for clients worldwide.

As an introvert, I value deep focus and meaningful connections. In my free time, you’ll often find me strumming my guitar or diving into the world of music—my favorite way to unwind and express myself.

This blog is my space to share ideas, experiences, and insights from both my professional and personal life. Thank you for stopping by, and I hope you enjoy reading!
